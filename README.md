### Unity ML-Agents
Unity Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents) is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents.

For game developers, these trained agents can be used for multiple purposes, including controlling [NPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character) behavior (in a variety of settings such as multi-agent and adversarial), automated testing of game builds and evaluating different game design decisions pre-release.

You can read more about ML-Agents by perusing the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).

### Project Continuous Control
In this project, I trained a robot agent that reaches a ball using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) , which work with the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment. </br>
